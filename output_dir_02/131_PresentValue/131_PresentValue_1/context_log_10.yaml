    Here is the supplementary doc you can reference:

    Write(range: str, value: str)

    Args explanation:

    range (string): The range to write the value into. Here, the range must be a single
    cell.

    value (string): The value to be written. The string in value also can be an Excel
    formula. A string starting with "=" will be treated as a formula. When using address
    indexing from another sheet in a formula, if the worksheet name contains spaces,
    its name must be enclosed in single quotes (e.g. ''Pivot Table''!A1). Please use
    correct absolute and relative references, e.g., $A$1, $A1, A$1, A1.


    Usage example:

    # Example 1: Write headers for the new column.

    Write("Sheet2!A1", "Date")

    Write("Sheet2!B1", "Sales")

    # Example 2: Write the formula into the cell.

    Write("Sheet1!A2", "=VLOOKUP(''Retail Price''!C2, ''Retail Price''!A:B, 2, FALSE)")
    # Must single quote the sheet name if it contains spaces.

    Write("Sheet1!A3", "=SUM(Sheet2!$A$1:$A$20)") # Absolute address.

    # Example 3: Add a new column after the A column named "Month".

    InsertColumn("Sheet1", after="A")

    Write("Sheet1!B1", "Month")


    Please use the above documents to generate the next step.
