True means underline, False means not underline.\\\\n\\\\nUsage example:\\\\n# Example 1: Highlight cells A1 to A10 greater than cell D1 with white text and red background.\\\\nSetConditionalFormat(source=\\\\\\'Sheet1!A1:A10\\\\\\', formula=\\\\\\'=$A1>$D$1\\\\\\', color=\"white\", fillColor=\"red\")\\\\n# Absolute reference is used for A1 because iteration is done for rows while the column is fixed. Absolute reference is used for D1 because it is the only target to be compared with.\\\\n# After implementing this action, the cells in range A1:A10 whose values >= D1 will have white texts and red fill.\\\\n# Example 2: lf column D contains the letter \\\\\\'H\\\\\\' highlight the colum F cell texts in yellow. \\\\nSetConditionalFormat(source=\\\\\\'Sheet1!D2:D\\\\\\', formula=\\\\\\'=ISNUMBER(SEARCH(\"H\",$D2))\\\\\\', color=\"yellow\")\\\\n# Absolute reference is used for D2 because iteration is done for rows while the column is fixed. source starts from D2 because the column header needs to be ignored.\\\\n# Example 3: Highlight the column B cells in Sheet1 between 2pm and 5pm in bold text. If the time is formatted as Text, TIMEVALUE can be used to convert time to factions. The following API call can be used in this case.\\\\nSetConditionalFormat(source=\"Sheet1!B2:B36\", formula=\\\\\\'=AND(TIMEVALUE($B2)>=TIMEVALUE(\"14:00:00\"),TIMEVALUE($B2)<=TIMEVALUE(\"17:00:00\"))\\\\\\', fillColor=\"yellow\")\\\\n\\']\\nHere is the corresponding sheet state:\\nSheet state: Sheet \"Sheet1\" has 2 columns (Headers are A: \"Hanging Mass (m2) (kg)\", B: \"Acceleration (m/s^2)\") and 122 rows (1 header row and 121 data rows).\\n'"
