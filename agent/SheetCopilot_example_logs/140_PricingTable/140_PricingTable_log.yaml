Context: 'My workbook contains two tables: Sheet "Sheet1" records my transactional
  data which are the number of rolls of fence sold on certain dates. Sheet "Pricing
  Table" is a pricing table used to determine price per roll according to the range
  the roll number falls in (The range is bounded by Units From and Unit To).'
Fail Response: []
Instructions: Fill the entire Price column by referencing the Number of Rolls column
  in Sheet1 to the unit range in the Pricing Table sheet.

    Note: The formula uses VLOOKUP to find the price per roll based on the number
    of rolls in column B. The range for the lookup table is ''Pricing Table''!$A$2:$C$5.
    The third argument of VLOOKUP is 3, which means the formula will return the value
    in the third column of the lookup table. The fourth argument of VLOOKUP is TRUE,
    which means the formula will find the closest match to the lookup value.'
