    Here is the supplementary doc you can reference:

    CreatePivotTable(source: str, destSheet: str, name: str, RowField: List = [],
    ColumnField: List = [], PageField: List = [], DataField: List = [], summarizeFunction
    = ''sum'')

    Args explanation:

    source (string): The range which contains the data used to create the pivot table.
    The source range MUST specify the sheet name and include the header row and it
    must also be a contiguous range from one sheet, not multiple sheets.

    destSheet (string): The name of the sheet to place the pivot table.

    name (string): The name for the pivot table to be created.

    RowField (list): The list of row fields.

    ColumnField (list): The list of column fields.

    PageField (list): The list of page fields.

    DataField (list): The list of data fields.

    summarizeFunction (string): The function is used to summarize the data in DataField
    only. It can be ''sum'', ''count'', ''average'', ''max'', ''min'', ''product'',
    ''countNumbers'', ''standardDeviation'', ''standardDeviationP'', ''var'', or ''varP''.


    # Note that, each element in the Field list can only be the name of the header.


    Usage example:

    # Example 1: Create a pivot table in Sheet1 based on the data from the range ''A1:C10''
    in Sheet1.

    # The pivot table will have the row field ''Name'', the column field ''Month'',
    the page field ''Year'', and the data field ''Sales''.

    CreatePivotTable(''Sheet1!A1:C10'', ''Sheet1'', ''PivotTable1'', [''Name''], [''Month''],
    [''Year''], [''Sales''])

    # Example 2: Sum the quantity of products sold by type.

    # Sheet state: Sheet "Sheet1" has 6 columns (Headers are A: "Date Time", B: "Web
    Site", C: "Product", D: "Type", E: "Quantity", F: "Discount") and 11 rows (including
    the header row).

    CreatePivotTable(''Sheet1!A1:F11'', ''Sheet1'', ''PivotTable1'', [''Type''], [],
    [], [''Quantity''])
