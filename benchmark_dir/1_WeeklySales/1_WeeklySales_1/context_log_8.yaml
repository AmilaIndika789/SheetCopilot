    Here is the supplementary doc you can reference:

    SetDataType(source: str, dataType: str)

    Args explanation:

    source (string): The range to set data type.

    dataType (string): The data type to set. It can be ''date'', ''text'', ''number'',
    ''currency'', ''time'', ''general'', or ''percentage''.


    Usage example:

    # Example 1: Set data type for the range (A1:B6) to ''date''.

    SetDataType(source="Sheet1!A2:B6", dataType="date") # Exculde the first row because
    it is the header.

    # After implementing this action, the range (A1:B6) will be set to ''date'' data
    type.

    # Example 2: Create a new column to store the profit.

    Write("Sheet1!C1", "Profit")

    Write("Sheet1!C2", "=Sheet1!B2-Sheet1!A2")

    AutoFill("Sheet1!C2", "Sheet1!C2:C6")

    SetDataType(source="Sheet1!C:C", dataType="currency")
