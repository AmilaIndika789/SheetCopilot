  to write the value into. Here, the range must be a single cell.\nvalue (string):
  The value to be written. The string in value also can be an Excel formula. A string
  starting with "=" will be treated as a formula. When using address indexing from
  another sheet in a formula, if the worksheet name contains spaces, its name must
  be enclosed in single quotes (e.g. \''Pivot Table\''!A1). Please use correct absolute
  and relative references, e.g., $A$1, $A1, A$1, A1.\n\nUsage example:\n# Example
  1: Write headers for the new column.\nWrite("Sheet2!A1", "Date")\nWrite("Sheet2!B1",
  "Sales")\n# Example 2: Write the formula into the cell.\nWrite("Sheet1!A2", "=VLOOKUP(\''Retail
  Price\''!C2, \''Retail Price\''!A:B, 2, FALSE)") # Must single quote the sheet name
  if it contains spaces.\nWrite("Sheet1!A3", "=SUM(Sheet2!$A$1:$A$20)") # Absolute
  address.\n# Example 3: Add a new column after the A column named "Month".\nInsertColumn("Sheet1",
  after="A")\nWrite("Sheet1!B1", "Month")\n'', ''SetDataType(source: str, dataType:
  str)\nArgs explanation:\nsource (string): The range to set data type.\ndataType
  (string): The data type to set. It can be \''date\'', \''text\'', \''number\'',
  \''currency\'', \''time\'', \''general\'', or \''percentage\''.\n\nUsage example:\n#
  Example 1: Set data type for the range (A1:B6) to \''date\''.\nSetDataType(source="Sheet1!A2:B6",
  dataType="date") # Exculde the first row because it is the header.\n# After implementing
  this action, the range (A1:B6) will be set to \''date\'' data type.\n# Example 2:
  Create a new column to store the profit.\nWrite("Sheet1!C1", "Profit")\nWrite("Sheet1!C2",
  "=Sheet1!B2-Sheet1!A2")\nAutoFill("Sheet1!C2", "Sheet1!C2:C6")\nSetDataType(source="Sheet1!C:C",
  dataType="currency")\n'']'
