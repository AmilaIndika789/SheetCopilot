  The range to auto fill from.\ndestination (string): The range to auto fill into.\n#
  The destination must include the source range.\n\nUsage example:\n# Example 1: Autofill
  down columns\nAutoFill("Sheet1!A1", "Sheet1!A1:A10")\n'', ''Write(range: str, value:
  str)\nArgs explanation:\nrange (string): The range to write the value into. Here,
  the range must be a single cell.\nvalue (string): The value to be written. The string
  in value also can be an Excel formula. A string starting with "=" will be treated
  as a formula. When using address indexing from another sheet in a formula, if the
  worksheet name contains spaces, its name must be enclosed in single quotes (e.g.
  \''Pivot Table\''!A1). Please use correct absolute and relative references, e.g.,
  $A$1, $A1, A$1, A1.\n\nUsage example:\n# Example 1: Write headers for the new column.\nWrite("Sheet2!A1",
  "Date")\nWrite("Sheet2!B1", "Sales")\n# Example 2: Write the formula into the cell.\nWrite("Sheet1!A2",
  "=VLOOKUP(\''Retail Price\''!C2, \''Retail Price\''!A:B, 2, FALSE)") # Must single
  quote the sheet name if it contains spaces.\nWrite("Sheet1!A3", "=SUM(Sheet2!$A$1:$A$20)")

  name of the sheet to insert column.\nbeforeColumn (string): The column before which
  the new column will be inserted.\nafterColumn (string): The column after which the
  new column will be inserted.\n\nUsage example:\n# Example 1: Create a new column
  at Column G in Sheet1, i.e, after Column F.\nInsertColumn("Sheet1", afterColumn="F")\n#
  The following call is equivalent.\nInsertColumn("Sheet1", beforeColumn="G")\n# After
  implementing this action, a new column will be inserted at Column G in Sheet1. The
  original Column G will become Column H.\n'']'
