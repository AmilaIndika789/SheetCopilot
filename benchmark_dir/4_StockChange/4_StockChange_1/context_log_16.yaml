    Here is the supplementary doc you can reference:

    CreateChart(source: str, destSheet: str, chartType: str, chartName: str, XField:
    int = None, YField: List[int] = [])

    Args explanation:

    source (string): The range that contains the data used to create the chart.

    destSheet (string): The name of the sheet where the chart will be located.

    chartType (string): The type of chart. It can be ''Area'', ''AreaStacked'', ''BarClustered'',
    ''BarOfPie'', ''BarStacked'', ''Bubble'', ''ColumnClustered'', ''ColumnStacked'',
    ''Line'', ''LineMarkers'', ''LineMarkersStacked'', ''LineStacked'', ''Pie'', ''XYScatter'',
    ''XYScatterLines'', ''XYScatterLinesNoMarkers'', ''XYScatterSmooth'', ''XYScatterSmoothNoMarkers'',
    ''3DPie''.

    chartName (string): The name for the chart to be created.

    XField (int): The index of the column that contains the X values, starting from
    1. If XField is None, the first column will be used.

    YField (List[int]): The indices of the columns that contain the Y values, starting
    from 1. If YField is [], all columns except the first column will be used.


    Usage example:

    # Example 1: Create a chart in Sheet2 based on the data from A1 to B10 in Sheet1
    and set the chart name to ''Chart1''.

    CreateChart(source=''Sheet1!A1:B10'', destSheet=''Sheet2'', chartType=''ColumnClustered'',
    chartName=''Chart1'')

    # After implementing this action, a chart named ''Chart1'' will be created in
    Sheet2 based on the data from A1 to B10 in Sheet1.

    # Example 2: Create a chart based on the data from A1 to B10 in Sheet1 and set
    the chart title to ''Chart1 Title''.

    CreateChart(source=''Sheet1!A1:B10'', destSheet=''Sheet1'', chartType=''ColumnClustered'',
    chartName=''Chart1'')

    SetChartTitle(chartName=''Chart1'', title=''Chart1 Title'')

    # After implementing this action, a chart named ''Chart1'' will be created for
    the data from Sheet1 A1 to B10 and the chart title will be ''Chart1 Title''.

    # Example 3: Create a scatter chart in the ScatterChart sheet with Columns B,
    C on the y-axis and Column A on the x-axis. XField is set as 1 to denote Column
    A. YField is set as [2,3] to denote Columns B and C.

    CreateChart(source="Sheet1!A1:B122", destSheet="ScatterChart", chartType="XYScatter",
    chartName="ScatterChart1", XField=1, YField=[2,3])
