    AutoFill(source: str, destination: str)

    Args explanation:

    source (string): The range to auto fill from.

    destination (string): The range to auto fill into.

    # The destination must include the source range.


    Usage example:

    # Example 1: Autofill down columns

    AutoFill("Sheet1!A1", "Sheet1!A1:A10")
