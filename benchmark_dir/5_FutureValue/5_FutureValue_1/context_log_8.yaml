    Here is the supplementary doc you can reference:

    SetCellMerge(source: str, merge: bool)

    Args explanation:

    source (string): The range to toggle cell merge.

    merge (bool): Whether to set merge. True means merge, False means unmerge.


    Usage example:

    # Example 1: Merge the range (Sheet1!A1:B1).

    SetCellMerge("Sheet1!A1:B1", True)

    # After implementing this action, the range (A1:B1) will be merged.

    # Example 2: Unmerge the range (Sheet1!A1:B1).

    SetCellMerge("Sheet1!A1:B1", False)

    # After implementing this action, the range (A1:B1) will be unmerged.
