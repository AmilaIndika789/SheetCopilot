intermediate response:
- Step 1. Insert a new column named "Angle (Radians)" between columns A and B.
- Step 2. Write the header "Angle (Radians)" for the new column B.
- Step 3. Convert angles from degrees to radians by writing the formula in B2.
- Step 4. Fill the formula for the rest of the rows in the "Angle (Radians)" column.
